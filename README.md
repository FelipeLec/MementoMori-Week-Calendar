Memento Mori is a side project I did just to kill time. Enjoy watching your weeks go by!

## About this
You can use it at https://mementomori.felipelecot.com/

## How do I use it?
- Insert your birth date on the input box.
- Press the button.

## What does it mean?
- The grey squares represent the weeks you have left to live, assuming you die of old age.
- The black squares represent the weeks you have lived. 
- It is only an approximation that goes up to 80 years.
    
## Ideas for future updates:
- Separation for time slept
- Dates on squares
- Animate squares
