Memento mori is a side project I did just to kill time. Enjoy watching your weeks go by!


## Prepare the content

This code is free, everyone can access it and use the calendar. It was developed using Bootstrap Studio, you can use it for free at https://mementomori.bss.design/

1. How do I use it?
    - Insert your birth date on the input box.
    - Press the black button.
2. What does it mean?
    - The grey squares represent the weeks you have left.
    - The black squares represent the weeks you spent. 
    - It is only an aprroximation that goes up to 80 years.
    
Ideas for future updates:

- Separation for time slept and at school
- Specific dates on squares
- Save domain where the app was used
